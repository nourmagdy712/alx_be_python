""""Requirements:
Core Functionality:

Your script should start with an empty list named shopping_list.
Implement functionality to add items to the list, remove items, and display the current list.
User Interface:

Use a loop to continuously display a menu with options to the user until they choose to exit. The menu should offer options to add an item, remove an item, view the list, and exit.
For adding items, prompt the user for the item name and append it to shopping_list.
For removing items, ask the user for the item name and remove it from shopping_list. If the item is not found, display a message indicating so.
To view the list, print each item in shopping_list to the console.
Ensure your script handles invalid menu choices gracefully."""
